A Hypixel Skyblock Farming Script(specifically MelonKingDe's Melon/Pumpkin farm) written in python.
[Here is MelonKingDe's Video](https://youtu.be/5k9c7qK0l58?si=MdLnzF8kmdAONxkB)
## Setup
* Download **"script.py"**
* Position yourself at start of your farm(yaw: 0, pitch:58/5-59)
* run /setspawn
* Script works with 3 plots and default amount of rows. also you have to have 400 speed.
* run **"script.py"** and alt-tab to Minecraft's window.
## Note:
You probably won't use this to farm cause it really depends on your connection, server tps and you have to have exactly 3 plots of farm. **But**, at least it's a good exercise to learn python keyboard based scripting. It works at leastðŸ˜‚
